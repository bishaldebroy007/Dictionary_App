# Dictionary_App
This Python code creates a simple dictionary app using Pygame. It loads a JSON dictionary, lets users input words, searches for definitions, and suggests similar words if needed. The results are displayed on the screen. Key modules used are Pygame for the GUI, JSON for data loading, and difflib for fuzzy matching.
