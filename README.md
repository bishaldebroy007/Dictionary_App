# Dictionary_App
This Python code creates a simple dictionary app using Pygame. It loads a JSON dictionary, lets users input words, searches for definitions, and suggests similar words if needed. The results are displayed on the screen. Key modules used are Pygame for the GUI, JSON for data loading, and difflib for fuzzy matching.
# Data Loading and Initialization
Loads a JSON file containing a dictionary of words and their definitions.
Initializes the Pygame library, setting up the display window and font objects.
# User Input and Search
Creates an input box where the user can type a word.
Provides a button to initiate the search.
When the user presses Enter or clicks the button, the code:
  Searches the dictionary for an exact match.
  If not found, uses a fuzzy matching algorithm to suggest similar words.
  Displays the definition or suggestion on the screen.
# User Interaction
If a suggestion is presented, the user can choose to accept or decline it.
The code responds to the user's choice, either displaying the definition or indicating the word is not found.
# Display and User Interface
Renders text on the screen, including the input prompt, user input, search results, and suggestions.
Draws buttons for searching and responding to suggestions.
Updates the display continuously to provide a real-time user experience.

In essence, the code creates a simple dictionary application that allows users to input a word and receive its definition or a suggested word if an exact match is not found.
